I am Shuheng Kong and my preferred name is Harry. I am planning to pursue a Master of Science degree in Biostatistics. I am particularly interested in expanding my knowledge and skills in biostatistics to tackle complex challenges in public health, clinical trials, and epidemiology. During my Master's program, I aim to go deeper into topics such as survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and Bayesian statistics.

In the long term, I aspire to pursue a PhD in Biostatistics to further advance my expertise and make significant contributions to the field.
