The most valuable volunteering experience for me was that I was one of the orientation leaders for new undergraduate students last summer. During discover week, I talk with my orientees (students in my orientation group) who are from various backgrounds and help them smoothly transmit into college life even after the discover weekends. Having small talks with my orientees whenever I came across them around campus and learning about their colorful college life gave me self-affirmation.
